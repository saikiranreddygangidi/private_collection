## Kermit The Frog

**Kermit the Frog** is a Muppet character created and originally performed by *Jim Henson*. Introduced in 1955, Kermit serves as the straight man protagonist of numerous Muppet productions, most notably Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, as well as in other television series, feature films, specials, and public service announcements through the years.

Henson performed Kermit until his death in 1990, and then *Steve Whitmire* performed Kermit from that time until his dismissal in 2016. Kermit is currently performed by Matt Vogel. He was also voiced by Frank Welker in Muppet Babies and occasionally in other animation projects, and is voiced by Matt Danner in the 2018 reboot of Muppet Babies.

### Life Lessons

Kermit has many things to teach us.
1. Itâ€™s not easy being green.
2. Some day we will find a rainbow connection.
3. 3. I am ready for the big time.
